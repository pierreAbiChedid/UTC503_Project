# UTC503_Project

In the context of the game of life by Conway, I created an application using python, pygames for display and numpy as a way to generate arrays that are convenient for my project.
I did not stray away from the original rules and preferred implementing them as they are presented in the wiki, because of the fact that the paradigmes of programmation are better
represented that way. 

The game's scale can be adjusted by simply changing one variable (scale) and nothing else. The grid will get bigger and smaller this way. 
For pygames, I chose the dimensions of my screen, but they can be adjusted too if needed.
The comments on the grid class will help make the code understandable.
